          <p>Committing to Linux seems like a badge of honor... <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/765cf44">or is it?</a></p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/world/international-programmers-day">International Programmer's Day - Wednesday September 13th</a></h3>
          <p>International Programmers’ Day was launched in 2007 to honor programmers.</p>
          <p>Many people observe International Programmers’ Day on the 256th day of the year because "256" (2^8) is the number of distinct values that can be represented with an 8-bit byte, and 256 is the highest power of 2 that is less than 365, the number of days in a year.</p>

          <h3>Unity charges developers per install</h3>
          <p class="font-30">Unity unveiled a new pricing model that assesses a fee to the developer when a user installs a game built with Unity, the rationale being that Unity incurs some cost when the user does this because they have downloaded and installed the Unity Runtime: <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">Unity plan pricing and packaging updates</a>.</p>
          <p class="font-30">Now instead of review bombing, you can literally bankrupt developers who release bad games! Just install the game 10,000 times.</p>
